===========

Compile with ghc on whatever platform you like. Note you don't pass the 
filename as a parameter, rather the program prompts you for the filename.

The input file is a list of messages to rotate through, with each message
on its own line.

The output file is a valid tf2 .cfg file which will rotate through the
input messages every time you press a key 
(choose the key by modifying the .cfg file)

With simple modifications, you could make this script very annoying.
